      <div class="column">
        <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
          <p>Hello!<br> I’m Kevin Wairi Senior Web Developer specializing in front end development.
             Experienced with all stages of the development cycle for dynamic web projects.
              Well-versed in numerous programming languages including JavaScript, SQL, and C. Stng background in project management and customer relations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To be exeptional in the programming field where i can enhance my personal development and growth in the cooperate world and also
        be part of solving technical problems in the society with simple logics</p>
      </div>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      <div class="reasons">
        <h1>Why i took a class in programming!</h1>
          <p><strong> 1.  I Can Create Anything i Want</strong></p>
            <p>At its core, computer programming gives me the ability to digitize my ideas.
               Imagine being able to actually implement any idea that i could think about!</p>
          <p><strong> 2. Instant Scalability</strong></p>
            <p>There is nothing else in this world that can scale its problem solving capabilities to the rest of the world
              like software development or computer programming can. For example, if i create an application or a website
              that monitors someone’s heart-rate, lets them measure their caloric count, or tracks their spending, then all
              of a sudden hundreds of millions of people can have their fitness or finance related problems solved with the click of a button.
               I mean think about Uber right… Someone had an epic idea and they set out to turn it into a reality. They set out to digitize their
                idea into a mobile application by using their computer programming skills. Once they had completed and published the app,
                it was downloadable by millions of users instantly.</p>
          <p><strong> 3. A Job is Guaranteed</strong></p>
            <p>We are living in the digital age and the growth of technology does not seem to be coming to a stop. As a matter of fact,
              the use of electronic devices is growing exponentially every year and so you can be sure that there is going to be no shortage
              of jobs in the computer programming industry… Only growth. </p>
          <p><strong> 4. Money</strong></p>
            <p>You will only make money when you can solve other people’s problems and help them achieve their dreams.
               That is effectively what a job actually is by definition. An entrepreneur who starts his own business is also simply trying
                to help others reach their goals and in turn those others help the entrepreneur reach his or her goal of financial freedom.</p>
